- The deployed application can be found at
https://petitspoissons.github.io/code-quiz/index.html
- The application features a timer, and a time delay to give time to the user to see if the answer is correct or wrong. A penalty of 10s is inflicted for wrong answers.
- The top five scores are kept in local storage. The application features a function to sort scores in descending order and evaluate whether or not a new score made it in the top 5. Users can access the top 5 list by clicking on a link to a page that dynamically displays that list in descending order.
